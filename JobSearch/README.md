### Simple analysis of my records of my personal job search.
Data file is scrubbed of some of the finer details.
In it you get a row for each job app, with a 0/1 flag for response or offer. Location and date included.
Rows with a zero for 'App' column were rows recording major resume changes, etc. Not apps.
